# Unity-Terrain-Generation

A small program which allows you to create terrain mesh based on a noisemap.
Allows you to edit the terrain in edit mode.

There are different shaders, ranging from basic flat shading ("low poly look"), to a color shader
with blending, to a texture shader with blending.

Based on the tutorial series by Sebastian Lague:
